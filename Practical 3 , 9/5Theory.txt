#clustering:It is grouping of data object based on their feature,it is 
unsuperred machine learning technique 
#k-means clustering:is unsuperwised machine learning clustering algorithm
it is a simplest algorithm in which dataset is partitioned into k cluster
it is centroid based method in which cluster are associated with centroid 

#Advantages:1.simple to implement 2.scale to large dataset
#Disadvantages:1.choosing K-manually 2.dependent on initial values
