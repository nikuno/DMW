#Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on 
Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems
#It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset.
#Naïve: It is called Naïve because it assumes that the occurrence of a certain feature is 
independent of the occurrence of other features.
#Bayes: It is called Bayes because it depends on the principle of Bayes' Theorem.
#Bayes' theorem is also known as Bayes' Rule or Bayes' law, which is used to determine 
the probability of a hypothesis with prior knowledge. It depends on the conditional probability
